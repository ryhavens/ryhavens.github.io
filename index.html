          <p class="title">One day, as I lay in my cradle debugging some C++ classes, it all made perfect sense to me. Programming is my calling,
            technology my passion, development my labor.</p>

              <p class="blt">I conducted a psychological analysis of the Tufts University "Meme Page," a Facebook group where
                students posted memes satirizing daily life at Tufts. I wanted to figure out the relationship between various
                memes that were posted on the page. This culminated in a fully-fledged data scraper, data analysis,
                and even a fun (yet currently broken) interactive visualization.</p>

              <p class="blt">A simple implementation of a common security vulnerability in web browsers used to track user
                data without them even knowing their data has been stolen.</p>

              <p class="blt">face.the.music is a fun little webapp that recognizes facial expressions and plays music according to your
                detected emotional state. The project came about as some hacky combination of working with the Spotify API
                (which I wanted to do) and working with facial recognition libraries (co-founder Gain Hagenau's idea). Somehow
                it caught on - people seem to find this kind of thing at least mildly amusing, and the music it plays seems
                to pair quite well (according to user feedback).</p>

              <p class="blt">For a class project I collaborated with a team of Tufts students to develop a business model and financial
                plan for our grand idea, a student-to-student subletting service. On my own I brought the project to fruition,
                and Subleasy provides a much-needed convenience to Tufts students seeking off-campus housing for a few
                months at a time.</p>
